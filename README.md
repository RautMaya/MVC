ðŸ§± MVC Architecture
This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, which is widely used to organize code in a structured and maintainable way.

ðŸ”¹ Model
Represents the data layer of the application.

Manages the logic for data storage, retrieval, and rules.

Handles communication with the SQL Database.

In this project, it includes:

Product details

Billing records

Customer information

ðŸ”¹ View
Represents the presentation layer.

Displays data to the user and captures user input.

Implemented using Windows Forms (WinForms) in C#.NET.

Provides interfaces such as:

Product entry form

Billing screen

Summary reports

ðŸ”¹ Controller
Acts as the intermediary between Model and View.

Handles user actions, processes business logic, and updates the view accordingly.

Coordinates between the database (Model) and UI (View).

âœ… Benefits of MVC
Separation of Concerns: Each component (Model, View, Controller) has a specific role.

Maintainability: Easier to debug, test, and enhance specific parts of the application.

Scalability: Modular structure allows for easier future expansion.

Reusability: Logic and UI are independent, enabling code reuse.
